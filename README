These java files aim to provide simulation of a DNS client, a DNS server
and an attacker that aims to cache poisoning the DNS client.

// for reference purpose, if needed.
Some of the code are referenced from Wumian Wang's previous project, which
built a simple DNS resolver that can encode a DNS packet, send to a DNS server,
receive DNS response message and decode it.

Here we acknowledge that method for encoding a DNS message, and decoding
a DNS response message, are adapted from the previous work.

For simplicity, DNScache, DNSnode, ResourceRecord, and methods for actual
DNS lookup with real DNS servers, are (plan) not to be used in the
research project.

We will add functions that allow us to create a DNS response message,
similar to those created by actual DNS servers.

We will add classes and functions to represent different role: client, server,
and attacker.
// --------------------------------

TODO: 1. Add another constructor for DNSMessage, DNSHeader, and so on.
TODO:   This is to fit the requirement for encoding a DNS response message.

TODO: 2. Implement proper encoding methods, for encoding resource record.

TODO: 3. Add class to represent client, server, attacker.

TODO: (optional) fix bug in makefile (though "make clean" is working)
